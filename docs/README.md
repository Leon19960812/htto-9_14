# Documentation Overview

This directory organizes project notes and plans grouped by focus area.

- **architecture/** – structural descriptions of the optimizer and supporting modules.
- **guides/** – environment setup tips and engineering guidelines for contributors.
- **plans/** – active implementation roadmaps and design plans.
- **research/** – exploratory analyses, derivations, and experiment notes.

Each subfolder retains the original markdown files (converted to lowercase filenames) for easier navigation. Update this overview whenever new documents are added so the structure stays discoverable.
